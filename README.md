Group name: Ibis 
## Overview
We are planning to make a clone of the drawing software ibisPaintX. The app itself has many features, and we are only planning to copy some. These features are the basic tools of any drawing software. We'll start with the typical drawing interface, and include the basic tools, draw and erase. We'll also have some extra features, like shapes, stickers, color pickers, and transparency. Some potential features that will be a bit harder to include are layers, fill bucket, undo/redo, and different brush shapes.
