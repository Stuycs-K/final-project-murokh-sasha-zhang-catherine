# APCS2 Final Project
THIS DOCUMENT IS REQUIRED
## Group Info
PERIOD 3 <br />
Sasha Murokh and Catherine Zhang <br />
Group name: Ibis 
## Overview
We are planning to make a clone of the drawing software ibisPaintX. The app itself has many features, and we are only planning to copy some. These features are the basic tools of any drawing software. We'll start with the typical drawing interface, and include the basic tools, draw and erase. We'll also have some extra features, like shapes, stickers, color pickers, and transparency. Some potential features that will be a bit harder to include are layers, fill bucket, undo/redo, and different brush shapes.
## Instructions
The project is run the standard way.
As seen on the interface, simply click the buttons and drag the mouse around in the canvas, the slider is beside the tools and the colors are on the right. Drag to activate the current brush and draw. For image, click on the sticker on the pop-up sheet and click again to see your sticker.
For fliter, click the icon. If you want to clear the screen, press the clear icon. If you want to save the screen, press the button next to it.

## Bugs
The color wheel does nothing, and most of the stickers are useless as well.
